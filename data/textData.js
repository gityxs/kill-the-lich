actionData.talkWithScott.storyText = { english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh wow, you actually want to know about me? Well, I've been here a long time."<br>
Scott and you keep talking for a while, and then he mentions that he overheard you've been doing good work, and has more people to recommend you to.

actionData.bodyAwareness.storyText = { english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was tapping my pen on my chin when I suddenly focused on the sensation - was there a way to use 
my momentum on my own proprioception? To mindfully move each of my muscles at all times would be incredible! I could craft such fine tools!<br><br>

After some focus, I felt a new conceptual river open up from Overclock, flowing into the idea of being aware of myself. 
For a moment, it was incredible to realize that I could expand this way, but rapidly I felt I hit my limit of comprehension.<br><br>

Still, the newfound awareness had me desire to move around; I just had to find a purpose to do so.
`}
actionData.takeNotes.storyText = { english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started realizing the difficulties of understanding what was changing, so I started taking notes. 
At first, I recorded the patterns, but as it helped me understand exactly how Overclock was changing: it was 
substantially growing. I wondered how far this could go.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as I was writing while continuing to work the knots in my soul that I realized I was easily doing multiple things at once.
My thoughts felt split, yet not incomplete; I had the attention to give to both things at once. What else could I do at the same time?
`}

actionData.harnessOverflow.storyText = { english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An insight quickly arose, gained as I became more aware of the currents of momentum flowing through my soul. 
I noticed, in those currents, that some was splashing over.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I observed the spillage - where would it go? - and found that, eventually, it always rejoined the current. Now that I was 
looking for it, I realized my other actions that momentum had latched onto had much more violent currents and eddies, 
whirling in place and creating knots of movement, hindering transference.<br><br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I observed the various actions that I had thus felt out, I realized that Reflect and Distill Insight had some whirls 
I could smooth out by controlling their spins into joining the river quicker.<br><br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overclock was a storm, and difficult for me to fully access. I didn't quite understand, but feeling out those complicated ever-changing knots,
 it also sparked the tip of a memory. I had been confused - why was this familiar?
`}

actionData.distillInsight.storyText = { english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost immediately, my ability triggered successfully on yet another surprising option - 
the ability to understand what I was doing, to distill insight out of the complicated signals coming through.<br><br>
`}

actionData.reflect.storyText = { english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I simply sat down and closed my eyes, and tried to feel, or see, or sense in any way something that was possible.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to my surprise, it was the act of looking itself that I felt the momentum latch onto. 
I gained awareness - I was starting to understand the nature of how my ability was influencing things. 
However, as the monstrous complexity of what this meant started to hit me, I realized this would be a long journey indeed.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to experiment more - was there more I could pull out of this?
`}



actionData.overclock.storyText = {english:Raw.html`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Choose a valid target; get a little more out of it" is the Description on my ability Overclock. Abilities are given intuitively, 
and the Description was part of that intuitive understanding, given as soon as one has understood all of the words within the Description. 
Overclock works by using the concept of momentum to improve the target over time. The target will be denied unless it meets the criteria, 
which is any type of action you can do over and over until you get better at it.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That feeling, that concept - momentum - had been spilling over somehow from when I had the target set to itself. 
It felt as if there was a spinning vortex of movement, with splashes leaking. Momentum had 
started to apply itself in small ways to anything I started doing that fit the targeting criteria, and the momentum had 
me continue doing whatever it was, helping me to do so as long as I needed.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I stated doing something potentially targetable - even without me realizing it - the conceptual "spillover" from the vortex would latch on.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was more than I ever anticipated. I had targeted Overclock to itself so that I would be prepared so that the next 
time a threat came along, I would have a large pool of a fate-bending resource, and therefore - at least once - be strong enough 
to save more than only myself. Maybe then, I could learn to find some measure of peace.`

actionData.meetVillageLeaderScott.storyText = {english:Raw.html`
Introductions with Scott as a village leader are nothing to note - he tells me not to make trouble and that he's open to chatting about any problems. He wants to help make the community work well. He seems like a good man. Past the introductions, when I really strike up a conversation with him, he opens up. 

"Did you see any birds on the road?" the softly smiling man asks me, after we got the pleasantries out of the way. I didn't think to look for the birds, and told him so. "You should have! There's a particularly golden one I only got a glimpse of!" He's passionate about this, but I am not. There might still be something worthwhile in finding this "golden bird" though.

I ask if I can help out, and he gives me a job! It's just helping him out with some chores, but he pays me for it.

Scott is really nice. I wish more people like him existed - my life would have gone differently. The more I chat with him, the more I remember the few soldiers I knew who were similar. It's a good connection, a good memory, and I have precious few of those. 

It also reminds me of how those men died, which starts to be more than I can handle for the moment. I have to start reminding myself that this is somewhere safe, but ultimately I am not quite up to do the task of socialization. I'm glad I ended up here though, and for the peace it has offered me.
